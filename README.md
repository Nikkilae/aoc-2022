# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

This is a repository of all my [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Included in the repository are my puzzle input data and automated tests with the correct solutions.

Run the desktop GUI application: `cargo run --bin gui`<br/>
Run individual solutions with the CLI: `cargo run --bin cli <day number> <part number> <input file path>`<br/>
Run tests: `cargo test`
