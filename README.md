# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

This is a repository of all my [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Included in the repository are my puzzle input data and automated tests with the correct solution.

To run the solutions, install Rust and Cargo and do `cargo run --bin d1` where d1 stands for day 1, d2 for day 2 etc.
